# Resiliency at the Edge with AWS Hybrid & Edge, Fortinet and Megaport

## Introduction

In this repository, learn how to automate the deployment of a highly available architecture across AWS Hybrid & Edge Services. Using AWS Wavelength Zones (WLZ) and the parent AWS Region, we deploy a SSL VPN initiated by the WLZ to create a secure, high-bandwidth east-west traffic flow.

## Terraform Build
After all of this is configured, you are ready to run the terraform modules. To do so, run the following commands from this repository's directory:

```
terraform init -upgrade
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Once complete, your outputs might resemble the following:
```
Password = "i-01234567890123456"
Username = "admin"
Wavelength-Fortigate-DNS = "ec2-abc-def-efg-hij.compute-1.amazonaws.com"
lz_subnets = "10.0.20.0/24"
vpc_id = "vpc-01234567890123456"
vpc_range = "10.0.0.0/16"
wlz_subnets = "10.0.0.0/24"
```

**Note:** You might encounter the following error, which requires you to opt-in to the Fortigate AWS Marketplace offering. Follow the instructions below to remediate the error.
